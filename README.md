## dataAndCodesC-MOM Repository

In this repository you will find all codes and data needed to run all analysis presented in the manuscript Micheletti et al. in prep. "Relaxing the assumption of independent capturing, marking, and observing events of a classical integrated capture-resight and counting model when using a comparable state-space integrated model can improve population parameter estimates for sparse datasets"

The files are numbered in the order that they should run. You will need to have the software MARK installed in your computer. It is necessary to change the directory on the copied files before running (i.e. setwd() <- file.path(getwd())).

Any doubts, please feel free to contact me at: tati.micheletti@gmail.com
