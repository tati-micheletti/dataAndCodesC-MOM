In this repository you will find all codes and data needed to run all analysis presented in the manuscript Micheletti et al. in prep. How to improve confidence and accuracy of estimates in sparse capture-recapture studies? C-MOM: a concurrent marking observation hierarchical integrated population model formulation.

The files are numbered in the order that they should run. You will need to have the software MARK installed in your computer. It is necessary to change the directory on the copied files before running (i.e. setwd() <- file.path(getwd())).
